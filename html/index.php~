	<p>I made a quick fix and added the character name for the character's chronicle pages to 
	let users know which character is for each chronicle.</p>

	<p>I edited out echo checking statements that checked for variable existences. 
	I also added proper titles and headers to some of the pages and forms. 
	I also took out the social links and overflow scroll since they weren't working or did not look well. 
	I also started adding my Github changes to the index page as updates.</p>
