Website for D&amp;D Fansite

This website is for non-profit and is a hobby side project. Users can register, log in, and create their 
personal D&D character profiles to keep online without using real life paper sheets. Normally, players use character paper
sheets to keep track of their character stats, abilities, and background. The paper sheets, however, can be easily worn down, 
be disorganized, or lost. The writing can also become increasing messy and harder to read when players have to continually 
erase  and make corrections and write down new new content such as hit point values, new item descriptions, and story 
progression. The website is designed to allow users to create their character profiles and keep the information well-organized
and easier and more managable to look up and can make the content public readable. Not only can players record their 
character's main stats but they can also record and input information on their character's skills, spells, and item 
descriptions. They can also make chronicles or story logs for their characters. Players still have to buy the official player's
handbooks for information on how  to make and edit their characters and start planning roleplaying adventures, but my 
fansite will make recording and editing character profile and story progression much easier and manageable.
